      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <p><span><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />ODOR JUDGE</span></p>
<p>In order to test the effectiveness of new products, ‘odor judges’ are hired to smell volunteers’ breath, feet, and armpits. They make sure their judgment is accurate, the members of staff have their sense of smell tested monthly. Let’s hope those products are doing the trick, for the judges’ sake! </p>
<p> Salary estimates for an odor judge range between $19,000 and $52,000, based on the levels of stink.</p>
<p>Companies that have odor judges pertain to personal beauty, urinal cakes, and practical prank fart sprays.</p>
<p>As stated before the level of stank determines the salary of an odor judge. Therefore, the stanky a smell is the higher the salary of the stank smeller. </p>
<p>Minimal Requirements: The minimum qualifications to become an odor tester include <span>a bachelor's degree in chemistry</span>. Some employers prefer applicants with experience in the relevant industry; for example, to be an odor tester for a fragrance company, employers prefer you have previous experience in the beauty industry.</p>

<p><span>New findings in the 9/11 case as the FBI released new documents that could link the Saudi government directly to the attacks of September eleventh. This development comes after an executive order came from president Biden, allowing the government to further investigate the event. The document provides information that could prove that the Saudi government supported the high jackers in their attempts to attack the United States. These findings come after the twentieth anniversary of the attacks. The link comes between a student in Los Angeles who was believed to be a Saudi intelligence member. He provided travel assistance, financial support, and lodging to the terrorists, which ultimately aided the attackers in succeeding. The future of this case is unsure as they are not sure what will develop from here. </span></p>
