      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<p><span>New findings in the 9/11 case as the FBI released new documents that could link the Saudi government directly to the attacks of September eleventh. This development comes after an executive order came from president Biden, allowing the government to further investigate the event. The document provides information that could prove that the Saudi government supported the high jackers in their attempts to attack the United States. These findings come after the twentieth anniversary of the attacks. The link comes between a student in Los Angeles who was believed to be a Saudi intelligence member. He provided travel assistance, financial support, and lodging to the terrorists, which ultimately aided the attackers in succeeding. The future of this case is unsure as they are not sure what will develop from here. </span></p>
